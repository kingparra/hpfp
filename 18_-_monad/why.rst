*Why* do I want to learn to use monads?
***************************************
* To finally do practical things like file
  operations and talking to the network!

  * To understand others code
  * To use libraries
  * To make writing QuickCheck properties
    easier

  * such as, particularly...

    * command line argument parsing using
      optparse-applicative

* To have another tool for structuring programs
  (make refactoring easier)

  * separating effectful and pure code
  * representing sequencing of effects

* To make discussions online easier to participate in


Which parts of this chapter are relevant to achieving my goals?
***************************************************************
* The end of chapter exercises
* The type class laws
* How to write instances
* How to check instances for good behaviour
* Any examples where real libraries are examined
