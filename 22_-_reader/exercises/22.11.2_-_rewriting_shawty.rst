22.11.2 Rewriting Shawty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Remember the URL shortener?

.. Uhh, no. What url shortener? From where?

Instead of manually passing the database
connection ``rConn`` from ``main`` to the app
function that generates a Scotty app, use
``ReaderT`` to make the database connection
available.

.. What does the app function do?
   What is Scotty?
   What is a database?
   Why do we need to *connect* to the
   database, is it a remote resource?

We know you haven't seen the transformer
variant yet, and we'll explain transformers
soon, but you should try to do the
transformation mechanically.

Use this version of the app: `Main 
<https://github.com/bitemyapp/shawty-prime/
blob/master/app/Main.hs>`_.
