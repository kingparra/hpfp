12.5.3 Validate the word
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use the Maybe type to write a function that counts the number of
vowels in a string and the number of consonants. If the number
of vowels exceeds the number of consonants, the function returns
Nothing. In many human languages, vowels rarely exceed the number
of consonants so when they do, it may indicate the input isn't a word
(that is, a valid input to your dataset)::

  newtype Word' = Word' String deriving (Eq, Show)
  vowels = "aeiou"
  mkWord :: String -> Maybe Word'
  mkWord = undefined
