12.5.4 It's only Natural
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You'll be presented with a datatype to represent the natural numbers. The only
values representable with the naturals are whole numbers from zero to infinity.
Your task will be to implement functions to convert Naturals to Integers and
Integers to Naturals. The conversion from Naturals to Integers won't return
Maybe because Integer is a strict superset of Natural. Any Natural can be
represented by an Integer, but the same is not true of any Integer. Negative
numbers are not valid natural numbers.

  -- As natural as any competitive bodybuilder
  data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat deriving (Eq, Show)

  -- >>> natToInteger Zero
  -- 0
  -- >>> natToInteger (Succ Zero)
  -- 1
  -- >>> natToInteger (Succ (Succ Zero))
  -- 2
  natToInteger :: Nat -> Integer
  natToInteger = undefined

  -- >>> integerToNat 0
  -- Just Zero
  -- >>> integerToNat 1
  -- Just (Succ Zero)
  -- >>> integerToNat 2
  -- Just (Succ (Succ Zero))
  -- >>> integerToNat (-1)
  -- Nothing
  integerToNat :: Integer -> Maybe Nat
  integerToNat = undefined
