12.5.2 String processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Write a recursive function named ``replaceThe`` which takes a
   string, breaks it into words, and replaces each instance of
   "the" with "a". It's intended only to replace exactly the word
   "the".

   ``notThe`` is a suggested helper function for accomplishing
   this::

     notThe :: String -> Maybe String
     notThe = undefined

   Example GHCi session of the above functions::

     ·∾  notThe "the"
     Nothing

     ·∾  notThe "blahtheblah"
     Just "blahtheblah"

     ·∾  notThe "woot"
     Just "woot"

   The main function::

     replaceThe :: String -> String
     replaceThe = undefined

   A simple example of its use::

     ·∾  replaceThe "the cow loves us"
     "a cow loves us"

   Ok, are you ready? Bear witness to the abomination that I've created!

      :end-before: -- Question 2

2. Write a recursive function that takes a string, breaks it
   into words, and counts the number of instances of "the" followed
   by a vowel-initial word.

   A stub of the function declaration::

     countTheBeforeVowel :: String -> Integer
     countTheBeforeVowel = undefined

   Simple demonstration of its use::

     ·∾  countTheBeforeVowel "the cow"
     0

     ·∾  countTheBeforeVowel "the evil cow"
     1

   I can't believe you've done this!

      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 2
      :end-before: -- Question 3

3. Return the number of letters that are vowels in a word. Hint:
   it's helpful to break this into steps. Add any helper functions
   necessary to achieve your objectives.

   a) Test for ``vowelhood``
   b) Return the vowels of a string
   c) Count the number of elements returned

   Function stub::

     countVowels :: String -> Integer
     countVowels = undefined

   Example use::

     ·∾  countVowels "the cow"
     2

     ·∾  countVowels "Mikolajczak"
     4
