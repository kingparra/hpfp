-- The implementation for our name checker is similarly niave. It only cares
-- that the string isn't empty. "ðŸ’“" is a valid name, for example.

  -- That's more like it. Now we can tell the user what was incorrect in one
  -- go without them having to round-trip each mistake! Later in the book
  -- we'll be able to replace mkPerson and mkPerson' with the following:
  --
  -- mkPerson :: Name -> Age -> Validation [PersonInvalid] Person
  -- mkPerson name age = liftA2 Person (nameOkay name) (ageOkay age)
