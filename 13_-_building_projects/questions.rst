What are all the options for build tools?

  * bazel https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-06-convert-haskell-project-to-bazel/ https://rules-haskell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  * shake https://shakebuild.com/
  * nix
  * nix and bazel https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-03-15-bazel-nix/
  * cabal
  * stack
  * stack and nix https://www.tweag.io/blog/2015-12-09-stack-nix/
  * make ;)
  * plain old GHC and shell scripts

So, I have a project set up with stack. How do I produce an executable from it?

I think that I need to learn how to use cabal, because there are a bunch of tutorials I'd like to
follow that use it.
