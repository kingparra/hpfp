13.14.1 Hangman game logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You may have noticed when you were playing with the hangman
game, that there are some weird things about its game logic:

* although it can play with words up to 9 characters long,
  you only get to guess 7 characters;
* it ends the game after 7 guesses, whether they were
  correct or incorrect;
* if your 7th guess supplies the last letter in the word, it
  may still tell you you lost;
* it picks some very strange words that you didn't suspect
  were even in the dictionary.

These make it unlike hangman as you might have played it in
the past. Ordinarily, only incorrect guesses count against
you, so you can make as many correct guesses as you need to
fill in the word.

*Modifying the game so that it either gives you more guesses
before the game ends or only uses shorter words (or both)
involves only a couple of uncomplicated steps.*

A bit more complicated but worth attempting as an exercise
is changing the game so that, as with normal hangman, only
incorrect guesses count towards the guess limit.
