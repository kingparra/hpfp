4.9.2 Correcting syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Correct the code and try it out on GHCi.

1. We want a function that returns the length of a string + 1.

   Original::

     x = (+)
     F xs = w 'x' 1
       where w = length xs

   Corrected::
            
     ·∾ x = (+)
     ·∾ f l = x w 1 where w = length l
     ·∾ f "this"
     5

     ·∾  -- or, more simply

     ·∾ f s = length s + 1
     ·∾ f "this"
     5

2. This is supposed to be the identity function, ``id``.

   Original::

    \X = x

   Corrected::

    ·∾ (\x -> x) (1,2)
    (1,2)

    ·∾ id'' x = x
    ·∾ id'' True
    True

3. When fixed, this function will return 1 from the value ``(1,2)``.

   Original::

    f (a b) = A

   Corrected::

    ·∾ f (a,b) = a
    ·∾ f (1,2)
    1
