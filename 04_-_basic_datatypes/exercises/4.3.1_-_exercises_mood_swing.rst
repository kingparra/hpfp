4.3.1 Exercises: Mood Swing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given this datatype, answer the following questions::

  data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show

1. What is the type constructor, or name of this type?

   * ``Mood``

2. If the function requires a Mood value, what are the values you could possibly
   use?

   * ``Blah`` or ``Woot``

3. We're writing a function called ``changeMood``, and so far it has the type
   signature ``changeMood :: Mood -> Woot``. What's wrong with that?

   * ``Woot`` is a data constructor, and not a type constructor, or type name.
     In other words, ``Woot`` is a value, and not a type. The signature should
     be written as ``changeMood :: Mood -> Mood``, instead.

4. Fix any mistakes and complete the function::

     changeMood Mood = Woot
     changeMood    _ = Blah

   * This should instead be::

       changeMood Blah = Woot
       changeMood Woot = Blah

5. Enter all of the above into a source file, load it into ghci, and run it to
   make sure you got it right.
