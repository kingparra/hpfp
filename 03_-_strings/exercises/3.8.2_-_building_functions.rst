3.8.2 Building functions
------------------------
1. Write functions in your repl to transform these inputs to their corresponding
   outputs using only the list processing features mentioned in the chapter
   [#1]. Don't write a general purpose function -- these only need to work for
   the inputs provided.

   a. Given ``"Curry is awesome"`` return ``"Curry is awesome!"``
   b. Given ``"Curry is awesome"`` return ``"y"``
   c. Given ``"Curry is awesome"`` return ``"awesome!"``

   .. raw:: html

      <script id="asciicast-hIsJgpbHxXLAQfnLs9UuXPoSt"
      src="https://asciinema.org/a/hIsJgpbHxXLAQfnLs9UuXPoSt.js"
      async></script>

2. Now take each of the above and rewrite it in a source file as a general
   function that can take different string inputs.

   .. include:: exercises/3.8.2_-_building_functions.rst.d/building-functions/src/Lib.hs
      :start-after: -- Questions 1 and 2, page 83..84
      :end-before: -- Question 3, page 84
      :code: haskell

3. Write a function of type ``String -> Char`` that returns the third character
   in a ``String``.

   .. include:: exercises/3.8.2_-_building_functions.rst.d/building-functions/src/Lib.hs
      :start-after: -- Question 3, page 84
      :end-before: -- Question 4, page 85
      :code: haskell

4. ... I don't understand what this question is asking me to do.

   .. include:: exercises/3.8.2_-_building_functions.rst.d/building-functions/src/Lib.hs
      :start-after: -- Question 4, page 84
      :end-before: -- Question 5, page 85
      :code: haskell

5. Write a function called ``rvrs`` that takes the string ``"Curry is awesome"``
   and returns ``"awesome is Curry"``. You're expected only to slice and dice
   this particular string with ``take`` and ``drop``, not write a general
   purpose function.

   .. include:: exercises/3.8.2_-_building_functions.rst.d/building-functions/src/Lib.hs
      :start-after: -- Question 5, page 85
      :end-before: -- Question 6, page 85
      :code: haskell

6. Put ``rvrs`` in a module and run it.

   .. include:: exercises/3.8.2_-_building_functions.rst.d/building-functions/src/Lib.hs
      :start-after: -- Question 6, page 85
      :code: haskell

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#1] Namely ``(++)``, ``concat``, ``(:)``, ``head``, ``tail``, ``take``, ``drop``, and ``(!!)``.
