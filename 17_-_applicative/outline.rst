  * 17.11 Follow-up resources

    * Tony Morris; Nick Partridge; Validation library
    * Conor McBride; Ross Paterson; Applicative Programming with Effects
    * Jeremy Gibbons; Bruno C. d. S. Oliverira; Essence of the Iterator Pattern
    * Ross Paterson; Constructing Applicative Functors
    * Sam Lindley; Philip Wadler; Jeremy Yallop; Idioms are oblivious, arrows
      are meticulous, monads are promiscuous

    (**Note:** Idiom means applicative functor and is a useful search term for
    published work on applicative functors.)
