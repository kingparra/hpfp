17.9.1 Specialize the types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given a type that has an instance of
``Applicative``, specialize the types of
the methods. Test your specialization
in the REPL.

One way to do this is to bind aliases
of the typeclass methods to more concrete
types that have the type we told you to
fill in.

1. ::

     -- Type
     []

     -- Methods
     pure :: a -> ? a
     (<*>) :: ? (a -> b) -> ? a -> ? b

2. ::

     -- Type
     IO

     -- Methods
     pure :: a -> ? a
     (<*>) :: ? (a -> b) -> ? a -> ? b

3. ::

     -- Type
     (,) a

     -- Methods
     pure :: a -> ? a
     (<*>) :: ? (a -> b) -> ? a -> ? b

4. ::

     -- Type
     (->) e

     -- Methods
     pure :: a -> ? a
     (<*>) :: ? (a -> b) -> ? a -> ? b
