17.9.2 Write Applicative instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Write instances for the following datatypes.
Confused? Write out what the type should be.
Use the checkers library to validate the 
instances.

1. ::

     data Pair a = Pair a a deriving Show

2. This should look familiar.

   ::

     data Two a b = Two a b

3. ::

     data Three a b c = Three a b c

4. ::

     data Three' a b = Three' a b b

5. ::

     data Four a b c d = Four a b c d

6. ::

     data Four' a b = Four' a a a b
