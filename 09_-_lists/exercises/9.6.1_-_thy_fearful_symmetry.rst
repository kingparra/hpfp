^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Using ``takeWhile`` and ``dropWhile``, write a function that splits a string
   on spaces to return a list of words.
2. Next, write a function that takes a string and splits it into lines, as in
   the following (your job is to fill in the undefined function).
