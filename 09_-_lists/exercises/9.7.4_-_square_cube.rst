9.7.4 Exercises: Square Cube
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given the following::

  mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
  myCube = [x^3 | x <- [1..5]]

1. First write an expression that will make tuples of the outputs of ``mySqr``
   and ``myCube``.

   .. include:: exercises/9.7.4_-_square_cube.rst.d/square-cube/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 1
      :end-before: -- Question 2

2. Now alter that expression so that it only uses the x and y values that are
   less than 50.

   .. include:: exercises/9.7.4_-_square_cube.rst.d/square-cube/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 2
      :end-before: -- Question 3

3. Apply another function to that list comprehension to determine how many
   tuples inhabit your output list.

   .. include:: exercises/9.7.4_-_square_cube.rst.d/square-cube/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 3
      :end-line: 14

   Navigate to ``exercises/9.7.4_-_square_cube.rst.d/square-cube/`` and run
   ``stack test`` to verify.
