9.10.1 Exercises: Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Something like this::

    Prelude> filter (\x -> x `rem` 3 == 0) [1..100]
    [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57,60,63,66,69,72,75,78,81,84,87,90,93,96,99]

2. Just apply length to the result of the last expression::

    Prelude> length $ filter (\x -> x `rem` 3 == 0) [1..100]
    33

   Or like this::

    Prelude> length . filter (\x -> x `rem` 3 == 0) $ [1..100]
    33

3. Ok, let's do this::

    Prelude> articles = ["the","a","an"]
    Prelude> myFilter s = filter (\x -> (x `elem` articles) /= True) (words s)
    Prelude> myFilter "the brown dog was a goof"
    ["brown","dog","was","goof"]
