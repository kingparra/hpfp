9.10.1 Exercises: Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Given the following example, from figure 5:

   .. include:: figures/9.10/fig_5.txt
      :code:

   How might we write a filter function that will give
   us all the multiples of 3 out of a list from 1..30?

2. Recalling what we learned about function
   composition, how could we compose the above
   function with the length function to tell
   us how many multiples of 3 there are between
   1 and 30?

3. Next, we're going to work on removing all articles
   ("the", "a", and "an") from sentences. You want to
   get to something that works like this::

     Prelude> myFilter "the brown dog was a goof"
     ["brown","dog","was","goof"]

   You may recall that earlier in this chapter, we
   asked you to write a function that separates a
   string into a list of strings by separating them
   at spaces. That is a standard library function
   called words.  You may consider starting this
   exercise by using words (or your own version, of
   course).
