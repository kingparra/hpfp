9.7.2 Exercises: Comprehend thy lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Take a look at the following functions, determine what
you think the output lists will be, and then run them
in your REPL to verify. (Note that you will need the
``mySqr`` list from above in scope to do this.)

Here is ``mySqr``, again, for convenience::

  mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..10]]

1. ``[x | x <- mySqr, rem x 2 == 0]``
2. ``[(x,y) | x <- mySqr, y <- mySqr, x < 50, y > 50]``
3. ``take 5 [(x,y) | x <- mySqr, y <- mySqr, x < 50, y > 50]``

I've tested these out in a terminal session. My guesses are left as comments in it.

There is also a stack project under
``exercises/9.7.2_-_compehend_thy_lists.rst.d/``
that includes tests you can run by navigating to
that directory and then running ``stack test``.
