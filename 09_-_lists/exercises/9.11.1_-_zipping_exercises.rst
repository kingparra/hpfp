9.11.1 Zipping exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Write your own version ``zip``, and ensure it
   behaves the same as the original::

    zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
    zip = undefined

2. Do what you did for zip but now for ``zipWith``::

    zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
    zipWith = undefined

3. Rewrite your ``zip`` in terms of the ``zipWith`` you
   wrote.
