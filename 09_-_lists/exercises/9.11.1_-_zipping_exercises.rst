9.11.1 Zipping exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Write your own version ``zip``, and ensure it behaves the same as the original:

   ::

     zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]
     zip = undefined

   Here is my attempt:

   .. include:: exercises/9.11.1_-_zipping_exercises.rst.d/zipping-exercises/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 1
      :end-before: -- Question 2

2. Do what you did for zip but now for ``zipWith``:

   ::

     zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
     zipWith = undefined

   Here is my attempt:

   .. include:: exercises/9.11.1_-_zipping_exercises.rst.d/zipping-exercises/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 2
      :end-before: -- Question 3

3. Rewrite your ``zip`` in terms of the ``zipWith`` you wrote.

   Here is my attempt:

   .. include:: exercises/9.11.1_-_zipping_exercises.rst.d/zipping-exercises/src/Lib.hs
      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 3
