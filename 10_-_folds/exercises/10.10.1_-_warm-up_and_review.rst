10.10.1 Warm-up and review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For the following set of exercises, you are not expected to
use folds. These are intended to review material from
previous chapters. Feel free to use any syntax or structure
from previous chapters that seems appropriate.

1. Given the following sets of consonants and vowels:

   ::

     stops  = "pbtdkg"
     vowels = "aeiou"

   a) Write a function that takes inputs from stops and vowels
      and makes 3-tuples of all possible stop-vowel-stop
      combinations. These will not all correspond to real words
      in English, although the stop-vowel-stop pattern is common
      enough that many of them will.

   b) Modify that function so that it only returns the
      combinations that begin with a p.

   c) Now set up lists of nouns and verbs (instead of stops and
      vowels), and modify the function to make tuples representing
      possible noun-verb-noun sentences.

      :end-before: -- Question 2

2. What does the following mystery function do? What is its
   type? Try to get a good sense of what it does before you
   test it in the REPL to verify it:

   ::

      seekritFunc x =
        div
          (sum (map length (words x)))
          (length (words x))

      :code:
      :start-after: -- Question 2
      :end-before: -- Question 3

3. We'd really like the answer to be more precise.
   Can you rewrite that using fractional division?
