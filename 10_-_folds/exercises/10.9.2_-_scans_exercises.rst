10.9.2 Scans exercises
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Modify your ``fibs`` function to only return the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.

2. Modify ``fibs`` to return the Fibonacci numbers that are less than 100.

3. Try to write the factorial function from Chapter 8 as a scan.

You'll want ``scanl`` again, and your start value will be ``1``. 
Warning: this will also generate an infinite list, so you may want to pass it through a take function or similar.
