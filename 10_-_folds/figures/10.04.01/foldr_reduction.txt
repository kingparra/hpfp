This figure illustartes the entire evaluation process of foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3].
Every function call is substituted for foldr's definition, with every occurence
of a parameter replaced by its corresponding argument value.

This chain of function calls is spread across twelve different figures on pages
351-353 of the book, which are interspersed throughout paragraphs 1-14 of section
10.4.1 "How foldr evaluates".

foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] =
  case [1,2,3] of
    [] -> 0
    (1:[2,3]) ->

With the extraneous strcture of each definition removed:   (+) 1 ((+) 2 ((+) 3  0))
Rearranged to use infix notation:                                 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))
