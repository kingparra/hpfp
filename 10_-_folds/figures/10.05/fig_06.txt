     foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
     --       [1]  [2]  [3]
     foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
     --       [4]  [5]  [6]

   1. The parameter of type a represents one of the list
      element arguments the folding function of ``foldr``
      is applied to.

   2. The parameter of type ``b`` will either be the
      start value or the result of the fold accumulated
      so far, depending on how far you are into the fold.

   3. The final result of having combined the list
      element and the start value or fold so far to
      compute the fold.

   4. The start value or fold accumulated so far is the
      first argument to ``foldl``'s folding function.

   5. The list element is the second argument to ``foldl``'s
      folding function.

   6. The final result of ``foldl``'s fold function is of
      type ``b``, like that of ``foldr``.
