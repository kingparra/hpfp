2.7.2 Heal the sick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code samples are broken and wonâ€™t compile. The first
two are as you might enter into the REPL; the third is from a source
file. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.

1. ``area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)`` should be ``let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)``
2. ``double x = b * 2``         should be ``let double x = x * 2``
3. this::

     x = 7
      y = 10
     f = x + y

   should be this::

     x = 7
     y = 10
     f = x + y
