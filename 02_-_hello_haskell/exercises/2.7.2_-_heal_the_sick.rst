2.7.2 Heal the sick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code samples are broken and won’t compile. The first
two are as you might enter into the REPL; the third is from a source
file. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.

1. ``area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)`` should be ``let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)``
   (Note that since GHC 8.0.1 you no longer have to preface name bindings
   with ``let`` in ``ghci``.)
2. ``double x = b * 2``         should be ``let double x = x * 2``
3. This::

     x = 7
      y = 10
     f = x + y

   Won't compile, ghc will make a complaint similar to::

    ~/P/h/0/exercises ❯❯❯ ghc healthesick3.hs
    [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( healthesick3.hs, healthesick3.o )
    healthesick3.hs:2:4: error: parse error on input ‘=’
      |
    2 |  y = 10
      |    ^

   ...so we should edit it to remove the extra indentation, like this::

     x = 7
     y = 10
     f = x + y
