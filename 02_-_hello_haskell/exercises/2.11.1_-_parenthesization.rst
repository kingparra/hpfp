2.11.1 Parenthesization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given what we know about the precedence of ``(*)``, ``(+)``, and ``(^)``, how
can we parenthesize the following expressions more explicitly without changing
their results? Put together an answer you think is correct, then test in the
GHCi REPL.

For example, we want to make this more explicit::

    2 + 2 * 3 - 3

This will produce the same result::

    2 + (2 * 3) - 3

.. raw:: html 

   <script id="asciicast-rLUmknNE4EFeCgxdKXVQMtuNX"
   src="https://asciinema.org/a/rLUmknNE4EFeCgxdKXVQMtuNX.js"
   async></script>

Attempt the above on the following expressions:

1. ``2 + 2 * 3 - 1``     becomes ``2 + (2 * 3) - 1``
2. ``(^) 10 $ 1 + 1``    becomes ``(^) 10 (1 + 1)``
3. ``2 ^ 2 * 4 ^ 5 + 1`` becomes ``((2 ^ 2) * (4 ^ 5)) + 1``
