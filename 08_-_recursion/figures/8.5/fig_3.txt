-- [1]: Dividend or numerator
-- [2]: Divisor or denominator
-- Result is quotient

20 divided by 4 == 20 - 4, 16
                      - 4, 12
                      - 4, 8
                      - 4, 4
                      - 4, 0
-- 0 is less than 4, so we stop.
-- We subtract 5 times, so 20 / 4 == 5
