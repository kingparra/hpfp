 Chapter 8 Objectives
**********************

* Dimensions of recursive thinking

  * **comprehension**: an indication the learner can describe the concept of recursion as well as the intent of a recursive solution.
  * **evaluation**: the ability to trace the flow of a recursive invocation and correctly predict the results.
  * **construction**: the ability to write or create a recursive solution.

* Be able to articulate what recursion is.

  * As a pattern in nature
  * In programming...

      * As a mechanism for controlling flow of execution

        * How does a function call work?

          * Function call stack

        * Using recursive function calls to perform an indefinite number of repetitions.

      * Recursive function calls as a mechanism for data flow

        * Parameter passing
        * Unique scopes

          * Environment records

        * Placing reduced values on the call stack, and pushing them upward

  * Explain how recursive calls play into the idea of a program as a graph of algebraic equations.
  * Explain the mechanics of recursion in lambda calculus using the Y-combinator.
  * Recursion as an algorithmic problem solving tool.

    * divide-and-conquer
    * reduction (in the computational complexity sense of the term) of a problem to another kind of problem
    * split-apply-combine

* Acquire a systematic method for defining recursive function definitions.

  * Steps for breaking the problem down into data definitions.
  * Tips for finding the what the final value depends on.
  * Tips for making sure the function terminates.
  * Questions to ask yourself when you're stuck.

* Do all of the chapter exercises.
