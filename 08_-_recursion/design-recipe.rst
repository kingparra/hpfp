Design Recipe for writing recursive programs
**********************************************
Stolen from http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/CS457-557/Haskell/RecursiveDesignRecipe.html.
Here is a set of steps to help you write recursive functions. If you follow each step you
are more likely to figure out what to do.

Here are the steps in general
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Write down several examples of how the function works (include both calls and outputs).
* Decide which of the arguments is the one that is recursively decomposed.
* Figure out the base case input for that argument.
* Figure out the recursion by breaking the non-base case input for that argument into multiple pieces.
* Give a name to each of the pieces, there might be 1, 2, or many pieces.
* Work out a recursive example

  * Pick an example from the several examples above that will be recursive.
  * Study the inputs and the result
  * Choose one of the named pieces of the recursively decomposed recursive argument as an
    argument of a recursive call. What part of the recursively decomposed argument (from
    the example) does that name refer to? What do the other names refer to?
  * What is the answer for that recursive call?
  * How can you combine the answer from the recursive call with the other named pieces to
    get the answer for the whole problem

* Use the steps from the generic program design recipe (where the structure of the body
  mimics the structure of the input data) to complete the function definition.

  * It is almost always the case that the structure of breaking up the recursive argument
    is the structure you need to mimic.

A concrete example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here is a concrete example for the list based ``length`` function.

* **Write down several examples of how the function works (include both calls and outputs)**

  ::

    length []      --> 0
    length [1,2,3] --> 3
    length [3]     --> 1

* **Decide which of the arguments is the one that is recursively decomposed.** ``length`` has
  only one argument, so there is little choice, that argument is the one that is
  recursively decomposed.
* **Figure out the base case input for that argument.** The base case is when the list is the
  empty list: ``length []``.
* **Figure out the recursion by breaking the non-base case input for that argument into
  multiple pieces.**  The decomposition is breaking the input list into the first element
  and all the rest of the elements.
* **Give a name to each of the pieces, there might be 1, 2, or many pieces.**
  We'll call the first element 'head' and the rest of the elements 'tail'
* **Work out a recursive example**

  * **Pick an example from the several examples above that will be recursive.** I choose the
    second example: ``length [1,2,3] --> 3``
  * **Study the inputs and the result.** The input is ``[1,2,3]``, the result is ``3``.
  * **Choose one of the named pieces of the recursively decomposed recursive argument as
    an argument of a recursive call. What part of the recursively decomposed argument
    (from the example) does that name refer to? What do the other names refer to?**

    Since length takes a list as input, only the named ``tail`` part makes sense as an
    argument to the recursive call, since it is the only list. ``head`` is an element not
    a list. The recursive call will look like (length ``tail``). ``tail`` corresponds to
    ``[2,3]`` and ``head`` corresponds to 1. What is the answer for that recursive call?

    ``(length tail) --> (length [2,3]) --> 2``

  * **How can you combine the answer from the recursive call with the other named pieces to
    get the answer for the whole problem?**

    The answer to the whole problem is 3, the pieces I have are:

    * 2 from the recursive call (length tail)
    * tail which is [2,3]
    * head which is 1

    I can get 3 by adding 1 to 2 (the recursive call).

  * **Use the steps from the generic program design recipe (where the structure of the body mimics the
    structure of the input data) to complete the function definition.**

    ::

      length [] = 0
      length (head : tail) = 1 + length tail

    It is almost always the case that the structure of breaking up the recursive argument is the
    structure you need to mimic.

    Note that the structure of the input is either the empty list, or a non empty list with first
    element 'head' and rest of the list 'tail'. Note how this structure is mimicked in the body of
    the function definition.

From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Identify the information that must be represented and how it
is represented in the chosen programming language. Formulate
data definitions and illustrate them with examples.

Signature, Purpose Statement, Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
State what kind of data the desired function consumes and
produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question what
the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the
signature.

Functional Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Work through examples that illustrate the function's
purpose.

Function Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Translate the data definitions into an outline of the
function.

Function Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the
purpose statement and the examples.

Testing
^^^^^^^
Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the
function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests
also supplement examples in that they help others read
and understand the definition when the need arisesâ€”and
it will arise for any serious program.
