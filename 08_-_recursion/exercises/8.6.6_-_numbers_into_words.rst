8.6.6 Numbers into words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this example undefined is a placeholder to show you where
you need to fill in the functions::

  module WordNumber where

  import Data.List (intersperse)

  digitToWord :: Int -> String
  digitToWord n = undefined

  digits :: Int -> [Int]
  digits n = undefined

  wordNumber :: Int -> String
  wordNumber n = undefined

Your output should look like this in the REPL when it's working::

  Prelude> wordNumber 12324546
  "one-two-three-two-four-five-four-six"

Alright, here is my attempt.

.. include:: exercises/8.6.6_-_numbers_into_words.rst.d/wordnumber/src/Lib.hs
   :code:

Here is a simple test suite. Navigate to
:file:`exercises/8.6.6_-_numbers_into_words.rst.d/wordnumber/`
and run ``stack test`` to see the output.
