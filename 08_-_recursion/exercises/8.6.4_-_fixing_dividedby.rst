8.6.4 Fixing dividedBy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our ``dividedBy`` function wasn't quite ideal. For one thing. It was a partial
function and doesn't return a result (bottom) when given a divisor that is 0 or
less.

Using the pre-existing ``div`` function we can see how negative numbers should be
handled::

  Prelude> div 10 2
  5
  Prelude> div 10 (-2)
  -5
  Prelude> div (-10) (-2)
  5
  Prelude> div (-10) (2)
  -5

The next issue is how to handle zero. Zero is undefined for division in math, so
we ought to use a datatype that lets us say there was no sensible result when
the user divides by zero. If you need inspiration, consider using the following
datatype to handle this. ::

  data DividedResult = Result Integer | DividedByZero

Alright, here is my attempt:

   :code:

...and a test suite...
