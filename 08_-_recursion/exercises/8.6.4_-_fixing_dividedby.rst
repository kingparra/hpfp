8.6.4 Fixing dividedBy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our ``dividedBy`` function wasn't quite ideal. For one thing. It was a partial
function and doesn't return a result (bottom) when given a divisor that is 0 or
less. Consider using the following datatype to handle division by 0 ::

  data DividedResult = Result Integer | DividedByZero

Here is my attempt. It's rather messy and I don't like it, but it works.

.. include:: exercises/8.6.4_-_fixing_dividedby.rst.d/dividedby/src/Lib.hs
   :code:

...and a test suite...

.. include:: exercises/8.6.4_-_fixing_dividedby.rst.d/dividedby/test/Spec.hs
   :code:

Navigate to :file:`exercises/8.6.4_-_fixing_dividedby.rst.d/dividedby` and
run ``stack test`` to execute the test suite.
