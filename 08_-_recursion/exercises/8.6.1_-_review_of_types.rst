1. What is the type of ``[[True, False], [True, True], [False, True]]``?

   a) ``Bool``
   b) mostly ``True``
   c) ``[a]``
   d) **[[Bool]]**

2. Which of the following has the same type as ``[[True, False], [True, True],
   [False, True]]``?

   a) ``[(True, False), (True, True), (False, True)]``
   b) **[[3 == 3], [6 > 5], [3 < 4]]**
   c) ``[3 == 3, 6 > 5, 3 < 4]``
   d) ``["Bool", "more Bool", "Booly Bool!"]``

3. For the following function

   ::

     func :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
     func x y = x ++ y

   ...which of the following is true?

   a) ``x`` and ``y`` must be of the same type
   b) ``x`` and ``y`` must both be lists
   c) if ``x`` is a ``String`` then ``y`` must be a ``String``
   d) **all of the above**

4. For the ``func`` code above, which is a valid application of ``func`` to both
   of its arguments?

   a) ``func "Hello World"``
   b) **func "Hello" "World"**
   c) ``func [1, 2, 3] "a, b, c"``
   d) ``func ["Hello", "World"]``
