1.8 Combinators
---------------
1a) A combinator is a lambda term with no free variables.
1b) Combinators, as the name suggests, serve only to combine the arguments they are given.

2a) So, the following are combinators, because every term in the body occurs in the head:


..
   figure 1

1. λx.x

   x is the only variable and is bound, because it is bound by the enclosing lambda.

2. λxy.x

3. λxyz.xz(yz)

..
  end figure 1

3a) And the following are not, because they contain free variables:

..
  figure 2

1. λy.x

   Here, y is bound (it's in the head of the lambda), but x is free.

2. λx.xz

   x is bound and is used in the body, but z is free.

..
  end figure 2

4a) We won't have a lot to say about combinators, per se.
4b) The point is to call out a special class of lambda expressions that can only combine the arguments they are given, without introducing any new values or random data.
