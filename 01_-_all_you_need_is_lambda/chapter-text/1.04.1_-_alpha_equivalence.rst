1.4.1 Alpha equivalence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1a) Often, when people express this function in lambda calculus, you'll see something like this:

.. figure 1

::

  位x.x

..
  end figure 1

2a) The variable x here is not semantically meaningful except in its role in that single expression.
2b) Because of this, there's a form of equivalence between lambda terms called alpha equivalence.
2c) This is a way of saying that the following expressions all mean the same thing:

..
  figure 2

::

  位x.x
  位d.d
  位z.z

..
  end figure 2

3a) In principle, they're all the same function.

4a) Let's look next at what happens when we apply this abstraction to a value.
