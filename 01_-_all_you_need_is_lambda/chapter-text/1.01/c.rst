1c) **Like Turing machines, the lambda calculus formalizes the concept of effective computability,
thus determining which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved.**

What does "problem" mean, here?

What is a "class of problem"? What are the problems classified by?

  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Complexity_class

  Complexity classes are sets of related computational problems.
  They are defined in terms of the computational difficulty of
  solving the problems contained within them with respect to
  particular resources such as time or memory.

  More formally, the definition of a complexity class consists of
  three things:

  * a type of computational problem,
  * a model of computation,
  * and a bounded computational resource.

What is a computational problem?

  A problem that a computer might be able to solve or a question that a computer may be able to answer.

How does formalizing the concept of effective computability help us determine which problems can be solved by a computer?

What is a *reduction*?

  A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem.
