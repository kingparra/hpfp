11.18.1 Multiple choice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Given the following datatype

   ::

     data Weekday = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday

   ...we can say:

   a) **Weekday is a type with five data constructors**
   b) Weekday is a tree with five branches
   c) Weekday is a product type
   d) Weekday takes five arguments

2. and with the same datatype definition in mind, what is the type of the
   following function, f? ::

     f Friday = "Miller Time"

   a) ``f :: [Char]``
   b) ``f :: String -> String``
   c) **f :: Weekday -> String**
   d) ``f :: Day -> Beer``

3. Types defined with the data keyword

   a) must have at least one argument
   b) **must begin with a capital letter**
   c) must be polymorphic
   d) cannot be imported from modules

4. The function ``g xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)``

   a) is recursive and may not terminate
   b) delivers the head of xs
   c) **delivers the final element of xs**

      Proof::

        ·∾ g xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)
        ·∾ :type g
        g :: [a] -> a
        ·∾ g "end."
        '.'

   d) has the same type as xs
