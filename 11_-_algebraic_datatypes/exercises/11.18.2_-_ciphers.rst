11.18.2 Ciphers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Expand on your Caesar cipher from last chapter by writing a Vigenere cipher.

A simple example using the codeword "ALLY" and the plaintext message "MEET AT
DAWN"::

  ALLY             -- codeword
  MEET AT DAWN     -- plaintext
  ALLY AL LYAL -- Cycle through the characters of
               -- our codeword, matching them to
               -- the plaintext.
  --
  -- Then we derive a shift for each character to
  -- match its corresponding character from the
  -- cycled codeword, and apply it, giving us...
  --
  MPPR AE OYWY     -- ciphertext

Ok, here is my attempt...
