6.14.4 Match the types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Can you substitute the second type for the first? Test all your answers.

The book asks me to create files for each of these, load them, and then change
the type. That's a lot of unneeded saving and loading, though, so I decided to
do everything in the repl, instead. If you don't want to suffer through my
typos, I suggest you download the ``*.cast`` file, and run ``asciinema cat`` on
it to view the entire contents at once.
