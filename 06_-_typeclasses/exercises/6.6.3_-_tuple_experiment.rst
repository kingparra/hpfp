6.6.3 Exercises: Tuple Experiment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Look at the types given for ``quotRem`` and ``divMod``. What do you think those
functions do? 

Test your hypotheses by playing with them in the REPL. We've given you a sample
to start with below::

    Prelude> ones x = snd (divMod x 10)

.. raw:: html

    <script id="asciicast-GijjMK9lDc02rngH5OA5bS1uF"
    src="https://asciinema.org/a/GijjMK9lDc02rngH5OA5bS1uF.js"
    async></script>

The answer seems to be ``divMod = (\x y -> (x `div` y, x `mod` y))``, ``quotRem
= (\x y -> (x `quot` y, x `rem` y))``. But honestly, I already knew that from
reading about it in chapter 4 and the hackage page for ``Integral``.
