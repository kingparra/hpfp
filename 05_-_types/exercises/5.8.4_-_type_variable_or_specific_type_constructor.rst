5.8.4 Type variable or specific type constructor?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. You will be shown a type declaration, and you should categorize each type.
   The choices are a fully polymorphic type variable, constrained polymorphic
   type variable, or concrete type constructor.::

    f :: Num a => a -> b -> Int -> Int
    --           [0]  [1]   [2]    [3]

   Here, the answer would be: constrained polymorphic (Num) ([0]), fully
   polymorphic ([1]), and concrete ([2] and [3]).

2. Categorize each component of the type signature as described in the previous
   example, ``f :: zed -> Zed -> Blah``.

    * Polymorphic, concrete, concrete.

3. Categorize each component of the type signature ``f :: Enum b => a -> b -> C``.

   * Polymorphic, constrained, concrete.

4. Categorize each component of the type signature ``f :: f -> g -> C``.

   * Polymorphic, polymorphic, concrete.
