5.8.8 Type-Kwon-Do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The focus here is on manipulating terms in order to get the
types to fit. Your goal is to make the ???'d declaration
pass the typechecker by modifying it alone. Not all terms
will always be used in the intended solution for a problem.

1. ``h = ???`` becomes ``h x = g (f x)``

2. ``e = ???`` becomes ``e x = w (q x)``

   .. include:: exercises/5.8.8_-_type_kwon_do.rst.d/Two.hs

3. ``xform = ???`` becomes ``xform (x, y) = (xz x, yz y)``

4. ``munge = ???`` becomes ``munge xToY yToWz = fst (yToWz (xToY x))``
