1. All function applications return a value. Determine the value
   returned by these function applications and the type of that
   value.

   a) ``(* 9) 6`` ::

        ·∾ -- This should have type Num a => a, I think, since (*) comes from Num.
        ·∾ :type (*)
        (*) :: Num a => a -> a -> a

   b) ``head [(0,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")]`` ::

        ·∾ -- Im guessing :: Num a => (a, String)
        ·∾ :type head [(0,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")]
        head [(0,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")] :: Num a => (a, [Char])

   c) ``head [(0 :: Integer ,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")]`` ::

        ·∾ -- :: (Integer,String), I think.
        ·∾ :type head [(0 :: Integer,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")]
        head [(0 :: Integer,"doge"),(1,"kitteh")] :: (Integer, [Char])

   d) ``if False then True else False`` ::

        ·∾ -- this is a Bool
        ·∾ :type if False then True else False
        if False then True else False :: Bool

   e) ``length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`` ::

        ·∾ -- length returns Int, so this will be :: Int
        ·∾ :type length [1,2,3,4,5]
        length [1,2,3,4,5] :: Int

   f) ``(length [1, 2, 3, 4]) > (length "TACOCAT")`` ::

        ·∾ -- length returns Int, (>) returns Bool
        ·∾ -- ... so I'm guessing :: Bool
        ·∾ :type length [1,2,3,4] > length "TACOCAT"
        length [1,2,3,4] > length "TACOCAT" :: Bool

2. Given

   .. include:: exercises/5.8.2_-_determine_the_type.rst.d/
                determine-the-type/src/Two.hs
      :code:

   What is the type of w? ::

      ·∾ -- Since w will reduce to a value, and all functions (*) (+) come from Num
      ·∾ -- I'm guessing w :: Num a => a
      ·∾ :type w
      w :: Num a => a

3. Given

   .. include:: exercises/5.8.2_-_determine_the_type.rst.d/
                determine-the-type/src/Three.hs
      :code:

   What is the type of z? ::

      ·∾ -- So, z needs one argument, so there will be two type variables
      ·∾ -- ...both with a constraint of Num
      ·∾ -- z :: Num a => a -> a is my guess
      ·∾ :type z
      z :: Num a => a -> a

4. Given

   .. include:: exercises/5.8.2_-_determine_the_type.rst.d/
                determine-the-type/src/Four.hs
      :code:

   What is the type of f?

5. Given

   .. include:: exercises/5.8.2_-_determine_the_type.rst.d/
                determine-the-type/src/Five.hs
      :code:

   What is the type of f? ::

      ·∾ -- Hmm...
      ·∾ :type (/)
      (/) :: Fractional a => a -> a -> a
      ·∾ -- f will fully reduce
      ·∾ -- I'm guessing f :: Fractional a => a
      ·∾ :type f
      f :: Fractional a => a

 I've also included some tests, which you can run by navigating to
 :file:`exercises/5.8.2_-_determine_the_type.rst.d/determine-the-type/` and
 running ``stack test:one``, ``stack test:two``, etc. (I'm using a somewhat
 experimental feature to perform the tests, though, so it don't count on it too
 much. I just did this to see if I could.)
