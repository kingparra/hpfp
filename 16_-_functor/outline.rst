* 16.17 Chapter exercises

  These exercises do not have titles, like previous chapters, but they do have
  subordinate elements, so I'm listing the problem description here, instead.

  * 16.17.1 Determine if a valid Functor can be written for the datatype
    provided

    * 1
    * 2
    * 3
    * 4
    * 5

  * 16.17.2 Rearrange the arguments to the type constructor of the datatype so
    the functor instances works.

    * 1
    * 2
    * 3

  * 16.17.3 Write Functor instances for the following datatype

    * 1
    * 2
    * 3
    * 4
    * 5
    * 6
    * 7
    * 8
    * 9
    * 10
    * 11

* 16.18 Definitions

  * Higher-kinded polymorphism
  * Functor
  * Lifting
  * George Clinton (the musician)

* 16.19 Follow-up resources

  * Haskell Wikibook; The Functor Class
  * Mark P. Jones; A system of constructor classes: overloading and implicit
    higher-order polymorphism
  * Gabriel Gonzalez; The functor design pattern
