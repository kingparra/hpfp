16.14.2 Exercises: Be Kind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given a type signature, determine the kinds
of each type variable:

1. What's the kind of a in ``a -> a``?

   ``a`` has the kind ``*``. Anything on the
   right or left of an arrow constructor must
   reduce down to ``*``.

2. What are the kinds of ``b`` and ``T``?
   (The ``T`` is capitalized on purpose!)

   ::

     a -> b a -> T (b a)

   ``b`` has kind ``* -> *``, since it takes
   one argument. The ``T`` type constructor
   also takes one argument, ``(b a)``, which
   is a type ``a`` wrapped by the type
   constructor ``b``.

3. What's the kind of ``c`` in ``c a b -> c b a``?

   The type constructor ``c`` has the kind ``*
   -> * -> *``, since it takes two arguments,
   and reduces down to ``*`` (a concrete type).
