-- This is a GHC environment file written by cabal. This means you can
-- run ghc or ghci and get the environment of the project as a whole.
-- But you still need to use cabal repl $target to get the environment
-- of specific components (libs, exes, tests etc) because each one can
-- have its own source dirs, cpp flags etc.
